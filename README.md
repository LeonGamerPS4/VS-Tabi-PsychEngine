# Psych Engine
(THIS IS TO COMPILE SOURCE CODE, PLEASE INSTALL BASE GAME FROM [GAMEBANANA](https://gamebanana.com/mods/335142) IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THE GAME NORMALLY)

You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.

Follow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

To install LuaJIT do this: `haxelib install linc_luajit` on a Command prompt/PowerShell
